Title: Energy Mastery â€” what it means
Energy mastery is about managing mental, physical and emotional energy instead of time. High performers build routines, prioritize sleep, nutrition, focused work blocks, and deliberate recovery. The idea is to maintain consistent energy across the day, using rituals to enter focused states and micro-recoveries for restoration.

Title: Avoiding Burnout
Preventing burnout requires boundaries, clear priorities, saying no to low-value work, and strong rest practices. High performers schedule rest like appointments, do weekly reviews, and reduce decision fatigue by simplifying routines.
