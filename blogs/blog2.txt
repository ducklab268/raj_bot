Title: Focus and Flow
Flow is achieved by matching task challenge to skill level, removing distractions, and using short focused intervals (e.g., Pomodoro). Minimizing interruptions and batching similar tasks increases deep work periods.

Title: Recovery Techniques
Short naps, breathwork, movement breaks, and digital detoxes enhance recovery. High performers treat recovery as part of productivity, not optional.
